I didn't want my content hosted on YouTube where it would be surrounded on all sides by an infinite expanse of flaming garbage.
But when my renewal email arrived in April, myself and other small developers were seeing sales slow down as the pandemic worsened.
But at my tiny scale and thinking about cutting costs, given the amount of video content I'm actually posting each month and hosting with them, and also being a huge nerd, it didn't make sense any longer.
I have zero understanding of how bandwidth is actually priced globally between providers or why some companies charge such a premium compared to others for the same bits over the wire.
It's a wonderful open source player from the kind folks at Brightcove that provides a similar level of control as the point and click customization options that Vimeo offers.
BunnyCDN offers their own online storage zones that you can simply upload to via FTP, but for historical reasons, I still store my large app downloads and videos on S3 and then have Bunny (and previously MaxCDN) pull from AWS as an origin server.
I just pass my video's filename to that script, and a few minutes later I can copy and paste the output into my text editor and make it available on my website.
You'll of course want to modify the paths to make it work with your own setup since it's completely specific to my needs right now.
On average, my bandwidth bill is about $11/month - and that includes videos, static assets, and ALSO binary downloads for all of my Mac apps.
It's definitely a geekier solution that requires more work up front to setup, and I'm not sure I would recommend it for a "real" business, but for my needs it was a fun project and I'm happy to save $200 a year.
