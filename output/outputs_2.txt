Former ICANN CEO Fadi Chehadé is currently listed as the co-CEO of Ethos Capital on the firm’s website .
Ethos Capital tried to buy Public Interest Registry, the non-profit that runs .org domains, but ICANN denied the transaction .
His involvement quickly became public because of Whois data for one of Ethos Capital’s domain names.
The private equity company admitted that Chehadé was an advisor on the deal.
For months, the Ethos Capital website listed only two employees: CEO Erik Brooks and Chief Purpose Officer Nora Abusitta-Ouri.
The website change listing Chehadé as co-CEO appears to have happened very recently.
Many industry observers may wonder if Chehadé was pegged to be a co-CEO all along, only omitted from the website to avoid more controversy.
Allen Grogan is Executive Partner and is the former Chief Contract Compliance Officer at ICANN.
Grogan’s LinkedIn page says he started advising Ethos last September; his involvement was disclosed after ICANN requested information on former ICANN employees involved with the company.
Chehadé’s LinkedIn page still lists him as a partner at Abry, the private equity firm that acquired Donuts .
